Phonopy configuration was read from "aiida.in".
Crystal structure was read from "phonopy.yaml".
Unit of length: angstrom
Settings:
  Supercell: [3 3 3]
  Primitive matrix:
    [0. 0. 1.]
    [1. 0. 0.]
    [-0.  1.  0.]
Spacegroup: R3m (160)
Use -v option to watch primitive cell, unit cell, and supercell structures.

Force sets were not found in "phonopy.yaml".
Forces and displacements were read from "FORCE_SETS".
Computing force constants...
Max drift of force constants: -0.000494 (zz) 0.000170 (yy)
Force constants are written into "force_constants.hdf5".
