# Tutorials

```{important}
Before you get started, make sure that you have:
* installed the ``aiida-phonopy`` package [see instructions](../installation/index.rst)
* configured the ``phonopy`` [(see instructions)](../installation/index.rst)
```

In this section you will find some tutorials that you will guide you through how to use the aiida-phonopy package, from **zero** to **hero**!
We devised the tutorials to gradually add more and more detailed features that you may want to use for your research.

Go to one of the tutorials!

- [Basic tutorial](./basic.ipynb): get starting with using in a general way the package, starting from defining the structure of a cubic silicon, to computing its phonon band structure.
- [Intermidiate tutorial](./intermidiate.ipynb): learn the concept of non-analytical constants for polar insulators, important for interpolating the phonon band structure.
- [Advanced tutorial](./advanced.ipynb): dedicated to learn more advanced options that you might need during your research.
